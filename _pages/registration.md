# Registration overview

All evaluation activities will be conducted using a NIST maintained web
platform. To register, each participant will need to create an account on this web
platform, which will allow them to perform various activities such as registering
for the evaluation, signing the data license agreement, and uploading submissions.

Step-by-step instructions for creating the evaluation account, joining a site and
team, selecting tasks, and signing the relevant agreements will be provided on this
page once registration opens.
