* **Must I participate in all tracks in the challenge?**

  > No. All participants **MUST** submit to track 1, but participation in
  > track 2 is optional.


* **Must I submit an abstract to the workshop?**

  > No, you are not required to submit an abstract to the [workshop](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard3workshop)
  > in order to participate. However, all teams are **STRONGLY** encouraged
  > to submit abstracts.


* **Must I submit a system description?**

  > **YES**. All teams are required to submit a system description by the
  > listed deadline that describes their submissions. Guidelines for what to
  > include in these system descriptions and their format are provided in
  > Appendix F of the [evaluation plan](index.html#plan).

* **Are teams with members from multiple sites?**

  > Yes, multiple sites may collaborate as a team on a task. However, one
  > participant from each site **must** sign and upload the LDC data license
  > agreement via the web-interface.

* **My team participated in a previous DIHARD. Can we use the development or
  evaluation set from that evaluation for training or development?**

  > The DIHARD I and II evaluation sets are off limits for _**ALL PURPOSES**_.
  > The DIHARD I and II development sets may be used however you wish, though
  > given that they are (with the exception of SEEDLingS) proper subsets of
  > the DIHARD III development set, we expect them to be of limited utility.


* **Can I use the DIHARD III development set to do data simulation and
  augmentation?**

  > Yes, development data is free to be used in any way you see fit,
  > including for tuning your current diarization system or augmenting
  > training data.


* **How can I upload the results?**

  > Please see the [results submission](submission.html#results) instructions.
