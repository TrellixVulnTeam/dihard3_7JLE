# Leaderboards

Real-time leaderboards for both tracks are maintained by NIST at:  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://sat.nist.gov/dihard3#tab_leaderboard](https://sat.nist.gov/dihard3#tab_leaderboard)

Leaderboards contain the most recent **primary** system submission by each team, ranked in ascending order by DER. Separate leaderboards are maintained for the core and full evaluation sets, yielding four leaderboards in total:

- **DIHARDIII_Task1_CORE**  --  Track 1 (core eval set)
- **DIHARDIII_Task1_FULL**  --  Track 1 (full eval set)
- **DIHARDIII_Task2_CORE**  --  Track 2 (core eval set)
- **DIHARDIII_Task2_FULL**  --  Track 2 (full eval set)

For each submission, the following fields are displayed:

- **ranking**  --  ranking of the system; systems are ranked in ascending order by DER
- **team name**  --  the name of the submitting team (possible anonymized)
- **submission id**  --  unique identifier for submission
- **der**  --  diarization error rate (in percent) of submission
- **jer**  --  Jaccard error rate (in percent) of submisson
- **submission date**  --  date submission was made

Results from the baseline system are posted to the leaderboard under team name **DIHARD**. These results are also available from the [challenge paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01477) and the [baseline github repo](https://github.com/dihardchallenge/dihard3_baseline).
