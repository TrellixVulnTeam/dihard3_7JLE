# Overview
Following the success of the [first](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard1) and [second](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard2) DIHARD 
challenges, we are pleased to announce the **Third DIHARD Speech Diarization
Challenge (DIHARD III)**. As with other evaluations in this series,
DIHARD III is intended to both:

* support speaker diarization research through the creation and distribution
  of novel data sets
* measure and calibrate the performance of systems on these data sets

The task evaluated in the challenge is speaker diarization; that is, the
task of determining "who spoke when" in a multispeaker environment based
only on audio recordings. As with [DIHARD I](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard1) and [DIHARD II](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard2),
development and evaluation sets will be provided by the organizers, but
there is no fixed training set with the result that participants are free to
train their systems on any proprietary and/or public data. Once again, these
development and evaluation sets will be drawn from a diverse sampling of
sources including monologues, map task dialogues, broadcast interviews,
sociolinguistic interviews, meeting speech, speech in restaurants, clinical
recordings, and YouTube videos.
  
Participation in the evaluation is open to all who are interested and
willing to comply with the rules laid out in the [evaluation plan](#plan). There is
no cost to participate and the web interface, data, scoring software, and
any baselines are provided free of charge.

For all details concerning the overall challenge design, tasks, scoring metrics, datasets, rules, and data formats, please consult the latest version of the official evaluation plan:

* [Third DIHARD Challenge Evaluation Plan (version 1.1)](docs/third_dihard_eval_plan_v1.1.pdf) **UPDATED July 13th, 2020**
* [Third DIHARD Challenge Evaluation Plan (version 1.0)](docs/third_dihard_eval_plan_v1.0.pdf)


# Workshop
The results of the challenge will be presented at a dedicated post-evaluation
workshop, to be held on January 23rd, 2021. Due to continued COVID-19 related
disruption, this workshop will be entirely virtual. For additional details,
please see the
[workshop website](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard3workshop/).

# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) for hosting DIHARD III
through the [OpenSAT evaluation series](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/opensat). All evaluation activities (registration, system submission, scoring,
and leaderboard display) will be conducted using NIST maintained
web-interfaces.
