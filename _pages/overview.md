# Overview
Following the success of the [first](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard1) and [second](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard2) DIHARD 
challenges, we are pleased to announce the **Third DIHARD Speech Diarization
Challenge (DIHARD III)**. As with other evaluations in this series,
DIHARD III is intended to both:

* support speaker diarization research through the creation and distribution
  of novel data sets
* measure and calibrate the performance of systems on these data sets

The task evaluated in the challenge is speaker diarization; that is, the
task of determining "who spoke when" in a multispeaker environment based
only on audio recordings. As with [DIHARD I](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard1) and [DIHARD II](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard2),
development and evaluation sets will be provided by the organizers, but
there is no fixed training set with the result that participants are free to
train their systems on any proprietary and/or public data. Once again, these
development and evaluation sets will be drawn from a diverse sampling of
sources including monologues, map task dialogues, broadcast interviews,
sociolinguistic interviews, meeting speech, speech in restaurants, clinical
recordings, and YouTube videos.
  
Participation in the evaluation is open to all who are interested and
willing to comply with the rules laid out in the [evaluation plan](#plan). There is
no cost to participate and the web interface, data, scoring software, and
any baselines are provided free of charge.

* [Third DIHARD Challenge Evaluation Plan (version 1.0)](docs/third_dihard_eval_plan_v1.0.pdf)


# Workshop
The results of the challenge will be presented at a post-evaluation workshop,
to be collocated with [Interspeech 2020](http://www.interspeech2020.org/) in
Shanghai, China on **October 25th, 2020**. All participants are invited to
submit 2 page extended abstracts describing their submissions and results on
the DIHARD III development and evaluation sets. Provisions will be made for
remote participation to accommodate those unable to travel to Shanghai due to
COVID-19 related disruptions. For additional details, please see the
[workshop website](https://dihardchallenge.github.io/dihard3workshop/).

While we will strive to meet the above milestones, continued COVID-19
impacts may require one or more milestones to be delayed.  Should this
happen, an announcement will be made to the mailing list and the schedule
adjusted online.  We thank you for your understanding in these trying times.


# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) for hosting DIHARD III
through the [OpenSAT evaluation series](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/opensat). All evaluation activities (registration, system submission, scoring,
and leaderboard display) will be conducted using NIST maintained
web-interfaces.
